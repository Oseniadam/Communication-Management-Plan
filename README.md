# Project Management Communication Plan
## A project management communication plan identifies how important information will be communicated to stakeholders throughout the project. It determines:

### 1 Who will be receiving the communication
### 2 How those people will receive it
### 3 When they'll receive it
### 4 How often they should expect to receive that information
